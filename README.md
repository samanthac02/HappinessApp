# Proof of Concept Apps

Current Location With GPS is an Xcode project that shows the user's current location with GPS (as the title suggests)

Current Location With GPS in SwiftUI has identical functionality to "Current Location With GPS but SwiftUI" requires a different code structure than the other project, which was built in Storyboard

Heart Rate and Watch Connectivity allows the user to see their heart rate measure by the Apple Watch from their iPhone. It combines the code from "Heart Rate" and "Watch Connectivity"

Heart Rate displays the user's heart rate on the Apple Watch

Watch Connectivity is the communication between a person Apple Watch and iPhone and requires code to establish that connection

Workout Information with Gyroscope shows on the Apple Watch the basic fitness information that you can find in the Watch's Workout application. It also displays the values retrieved from the watch's gyroscope and accelerometer

PulseSensor.ino is an Arduino project that works with a PulseSensor. I was to try experimenting with different sensors and considered pursuing my project with an Arduino and sensors instead of an Apple Watch
